I am building a crowdfunding application on mantle network, but the best application studded with features like multi chain funding using superfluid, multi token and streaming about the campaign using livepeer. 

Livepeer is a decentralized video streaming platform that provides a cost-effective and scalable way to stream video content. If you want to use Livepeer in your crowdfunding application, you can leverage its video streaming capabilities to enhance your platform's user experience.

For example, you could use Livepeer to stream live video of project updates, campaign pitches, or Q&A sessions with campaign creators. This could help to increase engagement with your platform and provide backers with a more immersive experience.

To use Livepeer in your crowdfunding application, you would need to integrate its API into your platform's backend. You would also need to create a Livepeer account and obtain an API key, which you can use to authenticate your API requests.

Once you have integrated Livepeer into your application, you can use its API to create and manage video streams, transcode video content into different formats, and distribute the video content to viewers.
