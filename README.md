# MantleFund
A Cross-chain Crowdfunding application built on Mantle Blockchain.

Integrating NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) in a crowdfunding dapp can provide a new and exciting way for backers to participate and support a project.
The owner of the campaign can send NFT's to some of the early supporters of the campaign thereby incentivising the backers to participate with greater zeal.

# Xapp Nested calls using Connext

Multiple blockchain support: MantleFund can use nested xcalls to interact with different blockchain networks to facilitate cross-chain transactions. 
When a user backs a campaign with cryptocurrency, the application can initiate a nested xcall to transfer the funds to the project owner's wallet on a different blockchain network. 
This can be especially useful if the project owner prefers to receive payments on a specific blockchain network.
